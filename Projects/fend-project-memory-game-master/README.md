# Mike's Matching Game

Welcome to Mike's Matching Game!
This is a project for Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree.

## Instructions

The object of this game is to match cards. You flip over the cards, two at a time, by clicking on them. If they match, they will stay flipped over. If they do not match, they will flip to the back side. Once you have matched all the cards, you win!

You will be graded on the number of moves it takes for you to win the game, as well as a clock that times your game.

Clicking the reset icon resets the game at any point.
